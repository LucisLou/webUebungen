                <p>The axolotl, also known as the <em>mexican walking fish</em>, is an amphibian, more specifically a neotenic salamander native to Mexico. They have been classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as threatened species in the red listing.</p>
                <p>Wild axolotls are rare, and the introduction of foreign fish in their native habitat has worsened the situation, as these fish prey on their young and take away the axolotls' food source. Furthermore, the expansion of Mexico City and the pollution of their waters drive them further into extinction.

                <dfn class="ptb">Despite their alternative name, Axolotls are not related to fish in any way.</dfn>
                <p>
                    Axolotls are bred in large numbers for research purposes, as their incredible regenrational ability and easily manipulative embryo make them attractive in various fields of study.

                <p>Axolotls are relatively easy to care for and hardy, which makes them suitable for beginner pet owners. Plus, their dietary needs are fairly straightforward. However, because they live their entire lives in water, you must be able to provide an adequate tank that is kept at the right temperature for this animal to thrive. </p>

                </aside>
                <p>While axolotls are relatively hardy to slight fluctuations in their environment, they also have delicate, soft bodies with permeable skin. In fact, most of their body is made of cartilage rather than bone. That means they should not be handled unless absolutely necessary. And if you do have to move them out of their tank, do so with a fine mesh net that won't entangle any of their body parts.</p>
                <p>Once you have their housing setup correct, you generally only have to spend a few hours per week on feeding and cleaning. The rest is simply enjoying them as a quiet, aquatic companion. Axolotls tend to be fairly bold and are perfectly content to move about their tank as they're being watched by their humans. Some will come up to the side of their tank when a person is there observing them.</p>

                    <h4>If you need further convincing on why axolotls could make great pets, here are some reasons:</h4>
                    <ul class="pb">
                        <li>They are easy to care for</li>
                        <li>In stress-free environments and good care, they can live up to 20 years</li>
                        <li>They are very docile despite being predators</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Axolotl is the type of creature that is going to eat literally anything edible it can find. It does not have to be edible either, which is why you need to avoid using big grained substrate. Since they are carnivores, you need to feed them meat-based foods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They need protein in order to thrive. Sinking pellets made for carnivores are perfect for them. Shrimp, bloodworms and earthworms are also very good for them. There are pellets specifically made for Axolotls as well that you can buy in most pet shops.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        You can feed it with your hand because even if it bites you, it will feel like touching sandpaper and won’t do any damage to your skin.
