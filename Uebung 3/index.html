                <p>The axolotl, also known as the mexican walking fish, is an amphibian, more specifically a neotenic salamander native to Mexico. They have been classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as threatened species in the red listing.</p>
                <p>Wild axolotls are rare, and the introduction of foreign fish in their native habitat has worsened the situation, as these fish prey on their young and take away the axolotls' food source. Furthermore, the expansion of Mexico City and the pollution of their waters drive them further into extinction.
                </p>
                <dfn class="ptb">Despite their alternative name, Axolotls are not related to fish in any way.</dfn>
                <p>
                    Axolotls are bred in large numbers for research purposes, as their incredible regenrational ability and easily manipulative embryo make them attractive in various fields of study.
