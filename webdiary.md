# Skill Diary - Web

## Week 1

I've already had a lot of basic knowledge on creating websites and styling them as well as using flex boxes. 
There wasn't much to learn for me since I already knew all there is to know for week 1 and 2 (Basics HTML und CSS 1 & 2).

#### I finished the competence check of week 1 with following main points:
* tables
* flexboxes
* :nth-child
* forms in its entirety

## Week 2

#### In the second week of Web I covered:
* styling a site with grid-boxes 
* respinsive sites with media queries
* pseudo-elements
* flip animations
* scaling of elements with calc()
* fit-content
